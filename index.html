							<p>College Board is known for their test taking platform via paper and pencil and providing students tools in which they can engage with various colleges and universities. My role within the College Board is extensive.<br /><br />My initial responsibilities involved taking UX/UI Designs and implementing them through out various College Board websites. That role then expanded to creating "Widgets", small UI/UX Application slices that can be installed on any website without having to recreate the entirety of the experience on different platforms within the company. <br /><br />Due to the nature of the Widgets themselves, extensive knowledge of various web platforms was required to maximize compatibility of the Widgets.<br /><br />Along side the Widgets, I worked closely with UX Designers to implement a unified branding experience across the various College Board websites and applications which include taking the design and development principles of the Widgets and applying them to Web Components that can be widely distributed across the company, further accelerating development efforts and the building of various brands the company is repsonsible for.</p>
